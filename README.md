Learning the fundamentals of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) by creating a sample app and performing major operations such as -

- Fetching data from a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) Server
- Add [Pre-Commit Hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) with [Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) & [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
- UI design using [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Theming & Styles using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- To-Do List using [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)
- Minifying images, css files using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) Plugins
- Internationalization using [react-i18-next](https://react.i18next.com/)
- Query Data from [Contentful GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/graphql/)
- Use [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) as an easier alternative to Redux for global state management
- Remember to add .env variables from your file to the Netlify env-vars under Build & deploy
  of your app settings. Netlify takes care of the CI/CD part.
